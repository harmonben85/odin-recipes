This project is the creation of a basic website using only HTML.
The website has a homepage with three links to web pages that have recipes for various foods.
In this project I learned about using links and images in HTML,
how to store the files needed to run a website using the command-line interface,
and how to commit project changes to git and write good commit messages.
